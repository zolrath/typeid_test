# TypeID Autogenerated IDs k-sorted test

To use this example

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Create a few Clients and then refresh the page. Note that they are no longer in the same order as the ID is not k-sorted like expected.
